Precision Plant Pathology: Image Classification with Computer Vision

**Description**

This project aims to address the challenges faced by the agricultural community in monitoring and managing plant diseases. By implementing an automated system using deep learning techniques, the project focuses on early detection and diagnosis of crop diseases, which can significantly improve intervention efforts.

The model uses deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to perform image classification on plant pathology datasets, accurately identifying and diagnosing different types of crop diseases. The project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning techniques for precision agriculture.

**Features**

Deep Learning Image Classification: Uses models for classifying plant diseases based on images.

Real-World Application: Applied to a dataset of crop images with labels of specific diseases.

End-to-End Implementation: From dataset preparation to model evaluation.

**Technologies Used**

TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning.

Python programming language.

Open-source datasets for plant pathology (e.g., Kaggle).
